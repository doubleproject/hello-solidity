This repo contains a simple coin contract (from official Solidity documentation). Follow the rest of this document to use double to build and deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

## Installation

If you haven't already, install Double CLI:

```sh
npm i -g double-cli
```

(work in progress)
